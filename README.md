# Flask REST Template

A template or boilerplate for a Flask REST application. This repository is a set of ideas that I have reading, listening or thougting about.

# How to test or start a project using this template:

* Clone this repo: ```git clone https://github.com/alexandre/flask-rest-tmp```
* Install the dependencies: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

# About the license:

The public domain license is fair enough for this project - union of repos that I saw, questions that I read in the Stack
Overflow or tweets (and I'm ok to share my ideas with this license). The most part of inspirations are using the MIT 
license, but if I choose another license, I'm sure that would be GPL/AGPL V3. =]

# About the inspirations:

* Ideas and answers >> #pocoo IRC channel;
* cookiecutter-flask;
* Flask Snippets;
* Flask-restful-example;
* [What the Flask](http://pythonclub.com.br/tag/what-the-flask.html) a tutorial in portuguese by [Bruno Rocha](https://github.com/rochacbruno)
* Flaskbook by [Miguel Grinberg](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg)
* Some questions in Stack Overflow or tweets that I don't have a link. =P

# About the design:

I will start to write about my studies [here](alexandre.github.io), but in portuguese. =]

# P.S:

 I am not a native english speaker, so I'm sorry if there are too many mistakes. =P
